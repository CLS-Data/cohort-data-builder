# Topic Tagger

Tags the variables of a survey or cohort study by topic, using a language model that runs
on your own machine through [Ollama](https://ollama.com). You control the topics and the
instructions the model is given by editing one plain file. While it runs you see live
progress; when it finishes you get a summary and a report with charts.

It reads variable metadata only (names, labels, value labels), never study data.

This folder is a self-contained project: copy it anywhere and it works on its own.
